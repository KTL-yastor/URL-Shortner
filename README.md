# URL Shortner
URL Shortener is a beginner project created to learn more about Express.js. The application allows users to convert long URLs into shorter versions, making them easier to share and remember.

# How It Works
1. Enter a Long URL: Users can enter any long URL into the application.
2. Get a Shortened Version: The application generates a unique shortened version of the entered URL. In reality, it's simply the next available number, resulting in very short links, especially when there aren't many links in the database.
3. Easy Sharing: Users can use the shortened URL to conveniently share the original link with others.

# How it's looks
